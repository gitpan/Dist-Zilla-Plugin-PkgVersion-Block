NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PkgVersion::Block - PkgVersion for block packages.

SYNOPSIS
        # dist.ini
        [PkgVersion::Block]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin turns:

        package My::Package {
            ...
        }

    into:

        package My::Package 0.01 {
            ...
        }

    for all packages in the distribution.

    The block package syntax was introduced in Perl 5.14, so this plugin is
    only usable in projects that only support 5.14+.

    There are no attributes:

        Having an existing assignment to $VERSION in the file is a fatal
        error.

        Packages with a version number between the namespace and the block
        are silently skipped.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
    In files with more than one package block it is currently necessary to
    end (all but the last) package blocks with a semicolon. Otherwise only
    the first package will get a version number:

        package My::Package {
            ...
        };

        package My::Package::Other {
            ...
        }
